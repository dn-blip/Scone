## Overview
Scone is a simple, command-line compiler for Scratch programs. It allows you to be able to rely on the simplicity of Scratch, while being able to surpass the speeds of Turbowarp, and soon even "real" programming languages like Python. 

## Installation 
To install the compiler, you can simply clone this repository, place it all in a folder, and add it to PATH. (for now)
